      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Righty</strong> was born out of a desire to make life easier for people who are job hunting.
        From personal experience, we know how stressful that process already is. What makes it worse is the
        feeling that many companies and recruitment platforms aren’t really trying to simplify the journey for applicants.
      </p>
      <p>
        Too often, job adverts lack essential information — like the required experience level or the salary range.
        This leads many people, unsure if they’re a good fit, to apply “just in case.” The result? Job postings become
        flooded with irrelevant applications, and the hiring process becomes overwhelming for everyone involved.
      </p>
      <p>
        This platform exists to address that problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        By using advanced machine learning, <strong>Righty</strong> predicts missing job details like experience level and salary range.
        The goal is to help applicants feel more confident in their decisions — and to encourage companies to realize that
        behind every application is a real person who deserves clarity and respect.
      </p>
      <p>
        We're here to make job applications smarter, and recruitment more human.
